### What I learned

I am so happy to discover the magic of wrapping divs, they are used in the strategic positioning of the child element with the display element. I also found out that semantic html can do the work of wrapping divs as well. For example, I can wrap an article element in a section element if I want to position the article's content in the centre using using the display property.

```html
<div class="parent">
  <!--This is a wrapping div, it helps in the organisation and placement of its child element in the webpage, -->
  <div class="child"></div>
</div>
```
